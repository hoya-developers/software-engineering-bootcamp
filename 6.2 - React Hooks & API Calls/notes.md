## React Hooks and API calls

This will be a very coding heavy class. We will be building a simple app that will make an API call to the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and display the data.

We will be talking about useEffect and API calls. We will also be talking about how to handle state and how to handle loading states.

We will go into some basic pagination and how to handle that with React.
