### Overview of UI/UX Design

#### What is UI/UX Design?
**UI** refers to the **user interface** of a website or app. It is the visual design of the product, and how the user interacts with it.

**UX** refers to the **user experience** of a website or app. It is the overall experience of the user, including the UI, the flow of the product, and the ease of use.

Together, these two concepts involve protyping screens of a website and considering how users will interact with it/how it looks.

#### Why is UI/UX Design Important?
People enjoy intuitive and appealing software. When you're building a service, bad UI/UX will cost you money and users. A good UI conveys proffesionalism. A good UX makes your product easy to use and understand.

#### Why is UI/UX Design Important for developers?
A well-done UI makes the development process easier. It allows you to understand what you exactly need to build and what goals you have to meet. Additionally, it saves you time when you have to restructure the site to add a new feature.

Having these skills also sets you apart from other candidates when applying for jobs. It shows that you have a good understanding of the product and can work with designers to create a great result.

We'll be using Figma for UI/UX design in this course.

### Design Principles

#### Font
Also known as typeface, font is the most basic way we can style text in our apps. It's key to select a visually appealing font that is easy to read and emotionally consistent.

#### Categories of Fonts
**Serif fonts** have small lines at the end of each stroke. They are generally considered more traditional and formal.

**Sans-serif** fonts do not have small lines at the end of each stroke. They are generally considered more modern and casual.

**Monospace** fonts have equal spacing between each letter.

#### Font Weight
Font weight is the thickness of a font, usually ranging from 100-900. The higher the number, the thicker the font.

#### Important Terminology
**Letter spacing** refers to the amount of space between individual characters.

**Line height/Letter height** refers to the amount of space between lines of text.

#### Google Fonts
Google Fonts is a free library of fonts that you can use in your projects. You can find it [here](https://fonts.google.com/).

#### General Design Principles
1. Avoid using more than 2-3 fonts in a single project. Using too many fonts can make your project look messy and unprofessional. We often aim for one font with varying weights and colors.

2. Don't combine two different fonts of the same typeface. For example, don't use two different serif fonts in the same project.

3. Page titles can use letter spacing of ~1-2%. Keep it default for body text.

4. Line height should be ~1.5x the font size.
