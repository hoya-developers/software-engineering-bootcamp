### Overview of UI/UX Design

#### What is UI/UX Design?
**UI** refers to the **user interface** of a website or app. It is the visual design of the product, and how the user interacts with it.

**UX** refers to the **user experience** of a website or app. It is the overall experience of the user, including the UI, the flow of the product, and the ease of use.

Together, these two concepts involve protyping screens of a website and considering how users will interact with it/how it looks.

#### Why is UI/UX Design Important?
People enjoy intuitive and appealing software. When you're building a service, bad UI/UX will cost you money and users. A good UI conveys proffesionalism. A good UX makes your product easy to use and understand.

#### Why is UI/UX Design Important for developers?
A well-done UI makes the development process easier. It allows you to understand what you exactly need to build and what goals you have to meet. Additionally, it saves you time when you have to restructure the site to add a new feature.

Having these skills also sets you apart from other candidates when applying for jobs. It shows that you have a good understanding of the product and can work with designers to create a great result.

We'll be using Figma for UI/UX design in this course.

### Design Principles

#### Font
Also known as typeface, font is the most basic way we can style text in our apps. It's key to select a visually appealing font that is easy to read and emotionally consistent.

#### Categories of Fonts
**Serif fonts** have small lines at the end of each stroke. They are generally considered more traditional and formal.

**Sans-serif** fonts do not have small lines at the end of each stroke. They are generally considered more modern and casual.

**Monospace** fonts have equal spacing between each letter.

#### Font Weight
Font weight is the thickness of a font, usually ranging from 100-900. The higher the number, the thicker the font.

#### Important Terminology
**Letter spacing** refers to the amount of space between individual characters.

**Line height/Letter height** refers to the amount of space between lines of text.

#### Google Fonts
Google Fonts is a free library of fonts that you can use in your projects. You can find it [here](https://fonts.google.com/).

#### General Design Principles
1. Avoid using more than 2-3 fonts in a single project. Using too many fonts can make your project look messy and unprofessional. We often aim for one font with varying weights and colors.

2. Don't combine two different fonts of the same typeface. For example, don't use two different serif fonts in the same project.

3. Page titles can use letter spacing of ~1-2%. Keep it default for body text.

4. Line height should be ~1.5x the font size.

### Color
#### How do we represent color?
Color is always presented (for digital purposes) in red, green, and blue values. One of these formats is **RGB**, where values range from 0-255. For example, white is represented as (255, 255, 255) and black is represented as (0, 0, 0). Alternatively, we can use **hexadecimal** values, where values range from 00-FF. For example, white is represented as #FFFFFF and black is represented as #000000.

#### Color Theory
There are a couple schemas you can use, coming down to personal preference.

The [color wheel](https://hgtvhome.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/hgtv/fullset/2011/7/18/0/HGTV_Color-Wheel-Full_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.1280.1280.suffix/1400967008479.jpeg) lets us visualize colors and choose a good pallete.

The first schema is **monochrome**. Here, we choose one primary color and then use different shades of that color. This is a good option if you want to keep your design simple.

The second schema is **complementary**. Here, we choose two colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. The Hoya Developers logo uses this.

The third schema is **greyscale**. We keep the design black and white, and use different shades of grey and images to make things interesting.

The 60/30/10 rule is a good rule of thumb for choosing colors. 60% of your design should be your primary color, 30% should be your secondary color, and 10% should be your accent color.

#### Coolors
Coolors is a free website that lets you generate color palettes. You can find it [here](https://coolors.co/).

#### General Design Principles
1. Avoud using harsh greys for containers. Opt for drop shadows or more natural contrast.
2. Stay away from > 2 completely different colors. Different shades of the same color are fine.
3. Ensure that text has plenty of contrast. [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) provides a good tool for this.

### Spacing and Alignment
#### Important Terms
**Padding** is the space between the content and the border of a container.
**Margin** is the space between two elements.

#### Visual Section
Is a set of elements that are grouped together with the same background/border.

#### Alignment
Never mix centered text with left-aligned text in the same visual section. It looks messy and unprofessional. Generally we prefer left-aligned text on desktop layouts, but centered titles and headers aren't rare and come down to personal preference.

#### Why is spacing important?
If a design looks bad, spacing is the most common reason.

#### Border Radius
Describes how sharp the corners of a container are. A border radius of 0 is a sharp corner, and a border radius of 100% is a circle. Overdoing it can look bad really easily.
