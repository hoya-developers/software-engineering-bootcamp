## Personal Project #1

Congratulations on completing the first third of the Software Engineering Bootcamp! Take a look at everything you have learned over the last 3 weeks:

- UI/UX Design
- Figma
- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- Github

It's time to put these new skills to use!

#### Assignment Overview

Your first personal project is building a personal portfolio website!

In the development world, personal websites complement your resum√© and allow you to showcase the projects you're most proud of. They also serve as a hub for your social medias and offers visitors a way to contact you.

For this assignment, you'll be creating your personal portfolio website using HTML/CSS.

#### Website Requirements

1. Your website should be a single-page HTML file with a corresponding CSS file.
2. Content should include:
   - Your name & short bio
   - A picture (recommended)
   - A list of your technical skills
   - A section for you to showcase projects you work on (for now, put Hoya Airlines and this pesonal project as examples)
   - Contact / social media information
3. Content should be organized using best CSS practices we discussed (flexbox, fonts, colors, etc.) and be visually appealing.
4. You should choose a font from Google Fonts to include as the main font for your site.
5. Your website should look reasonably good on a phone (you should implement media queries in CSS)
6. Your website must be a Git repository. You should utilize basic Git commands to create commits along the way. (See what you'll turn in below)

#### Submitting Your Project

**Due Date: Monday, 2/26 @ 11:59PM**

[**SUBMIT WEBSITE**](https://forms.gle/SgHom2VLXbvgmfdc8)

After submitting your website, you'll receive feedback from us on what we like and suggestions to make your site even better!

#### Recommended Steps

1. Search Google for UI/UX inspiration for how you want your personal website to look. You can also reference [Reed's website](https://reeduhlik.com) or [Colin's website](https://colingraydon.me) for additional inspiration. Note: The designs on Google will likely be way more involved that what we expect. Don't get overwhelmed if something looks too complicated!
2. Once you have an idea of what you want your site to look like, open Figma and create a mock-up for the design that you'll implement. Trust us - doing a thorough job on this step will make subsequent steps much easier!
3. Once your satisfied with your design, create a new folder for your website code and initialize a Git repo. Create the index.html and index.css files, as well as an assets folder to put any images you are including.
4. Code the HTML structure of your page while referencing your Figma mock-up, organizing your content into logical divs.
5. Once you have the HTML written, then add your CSS styles. We recommend using a split window on VSCode to see your HTML and CSS side-by-side.
6. Add media queries once the primary CSS is done.
7. Create a Github repo for your personal project, and follow the instructions given to upload your local git repo to Github. **Make sure the repo is set to public!**
8. Submit your project using the link above.
9. Congratulations on completing your first project!
